# Production Suite

A sophisticated job tracking system for print production workflows with USB scanner integration and real-time status monitoring.

## Features

✨ **Three-Panel Interface**
- **Left Panel**: Production queue with job status tracking
- **Middle Panel**: PDF preview and job details
- **Right Panel**: Production information, due dates, and timeline

🎨 **Modern Design**
- Premium dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- Purple-indigo gradient accents
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Responsive three-column grid layout

📊 **Job Tracking**
- Pending → Started → Completed workflow
- Smart scan timing (1-minute window logic)
- Visual status indicators with color coding
- Due date urgency highlighting

🔧 **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS with custom design system
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **PDF Handling**: React-PDF (ready for integration)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (currently working with 20.12.2)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/production-suite.git
cd production-suite

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Usage

### Scanner Simulation
Currently using keyboard simulation for development:
1. Select a job from the left panel
2. Press **Enter** to simulate scanning
3. First scan → Marks job as "Started" 
4. Second scan (after 60+ seconds) → Marks as "Completed"

### Job Status Flow
- **Pending** (Gray): Job created, not started
- **Started** (Orange): First scan recorded, work in progress
- **Completed** (Green): Second scan recorded, job finished
